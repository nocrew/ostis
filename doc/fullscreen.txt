Troed:

While researching for my optimized fullscreen scanline the big
difference between the naïve version;

0: HI
8: 50Hz
16: LO
376: 60Hz

... and the version that is (with wakestate-dependent modification) in Closure:

0: HI
8: MED
16: LO
24: 50Hz
376: 60Hz

... is that the naïve version (while GLUE statemachine compliant)
displays "bands" (every other 16 pixels black) in some wakestates or
"sub-wakestates"
